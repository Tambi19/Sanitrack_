# 🛕 Sanitrack – Cleanliness Made Smarter for Simhastha  

**Sanitrack** is a **QR-powered sanitation and task management web app** designed for the **Simhastha Mahakumbh**.  
By scanning a QR code placed across clusters, users instantly access the system and choose their role.  

---
## 📲 QR Flow – Landing Options  

When a QR is scanned, the user sees **4 clear options**:  
It connects **Pilgrims**, **Cleaners**, and **Volunteers** through a digital platform:

1. 👤 **I am a Pilgrim** → Submit complaints, give feedback, and find nearby toilets  
2. 🙌 **I am a Volunteer** → Assign cleaning tasks, monitor cleaners, and review pilgrim reports  
3. 🧹 **I am a Cleaner** → View assigned tasks and mark them as completed  
4. 🚻 **Nearby Toilet** → Instantly show the closest toilets in that cluster  

✨ This makes **Sanitrack fast, accessible, and role-specific** without requiring any app installation.
